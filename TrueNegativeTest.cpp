    // Create a shared pointer to a simple hash function (e.g., std::hash<std::string>).
    // This hash function will be used by the BloomFilter.
   auto hashFn = std::make_shared<SimpleHash>(std::hash<std::string>{});

   // Create an instance of the BloomFilter with a bit array size of 128
    // and a single hash function (provided in a vector).
    // The BloomFilter constructor requires the size of the bit array and a vector of hash functions.
    // The hash function is passed as a shared pointer to the BloomFilter.
   BloomFilter bloomFilter(128, {hashFn});

   // Define a URL that has not been added to the BloomFilter.

    // Act
    // Check if the BloomFilter reports that the URL is possibly contained.

    // Assert
    // Verify that the BloomFilter returns false for the URL that was never added.
    // This ensures that the BloomFilter behaves correctly for a "true negative" case.
