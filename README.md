# Mail

you can find our repository in the link: https://github.com/AlmogMeirov/Mail.git

**This part implements the Node.js web server (Exercise 3), responsible for user authentication, mail handling, and integrating with the blacklist TCP server from Exercise 2.**

## Purpose

In this part of the project, we developed a *Node.js web server* that exposes a RESTful API for handling a simple mail system (similar to Gmail). The server interacts with a C++ *blacklist server* from exercise 2 to verify links within mail content using a *TCP socket*.

The system supports:

* User registration and login with JWT authentication
* Sending and receiving mails
* Label creation and management
* Integration with the blacklist server (via TCP) to block mails with blacklisted URLs


## Build and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites:

* Docker
* Docker Compose

  
The following curl commands are written for bash on Linux-based systems.
They can also be executed on Windows using CMD or PowerShell, with appropriate syntax adjustments (e.g., quoting and escaping).

#### Step 1: Build & Start the Services
### Open fitst terminal:

  In the root project directory, run:

 ```
  docker-compose up --build
 ```

  This will build and start two services:

* mail-server: A Node.js web server on port 3000
* blacklist-server: A C++ TCP server on port 5555, connected to a persistent urls.txt file for blacklist storage

---

### Open a second terminal:
## API Usage
  ###  Register a user

   ```
    curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"<EMAIL>","password":"<PASSWORD>","firstName":"<FIRST_NAME>","lastName":"<LAST_NAME>"}'
   ```

  ### Login to get JWT token

  ```
    BOB_TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tokens -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"email":"<EMAIL>","password":"<PASSWORD>"}' | sed -n 's/.*"token":"\([^"]*\)".*/\1/p')
  ```
    Save the token from the response to use in future authenticated requests. (not exist in CMD, when you work in CMD you need to write down the token every time it requries).

## Mail

  ### Send a new mail

   ```
   curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/mails -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sender":"<SENDER_EMAIL>", "recipient":"<RECIPIENT_EMAIL>", "subject":"<SUBJECT>", "content":"<CONTENT>"}'
```
    If any link in the content is blacklisted, you’ll get:
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    X-Powered-By: Express
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 44
    ETag: W/"2c-lhpwL7K38bFeBMPyBndDrwyE2Ko"
    Date: Thu, 19 Jun 2025 09:42:07 GMT
    Connection: keep-alive
    Keep-Alive: timeout=5

    {"error":"Message contains blacklisted URL"}
  

 ###  Send mail to multiple recipients
  ```
    curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/mails -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"sender":"<SENDER_EMAIL>","recipients":     ["<FIRST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL>",...,"<LAST_RECIPIENT_EMAIL>"],"subject":"<SUBJECT>","content":"<CONTENT>"}'
 ```

  ### Get the 50 most recent mails

  ```
    curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/mails -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>"
 ```

  ### Search mails by query

  ```
    curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/mails?q="<QUERY>" -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>"
```
    Replace <QUERY> with the search string you want.
  

  ### Search mails by ID
   ```
    curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/mails/<MAIL_ID> -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>"
  ```
Replace <MAIL_ID> with the ID of the mail you want.

  ### Assigning a label to a mail
  
  ```
  curl -i -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/mails/<MAIL_ID>/label -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"labels":"[<label name>]"}'
  ```


## Labels

  ### Create a label

 ```
 curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/labels -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"<label name>"}'
 ```

  ### View all labels

   ```
    curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/labels -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>"
  ```

  #### Get a label by ID for the current user
  ```
curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/labels/<LABEL_ID> -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>"
  ```
  
  ### Update a label by ID for the current user
  ```
  curl -i -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/labels/<LABEL_ID> -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name": "<UpdatedLabelName>"}'
  ```
  
  ### Delete a label by ID for the current user
  ```
  curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/labels/<LABEL_ID> -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>"
  ```
  ### Search labels by substring in name
  ```
  curl -i -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/labels/search/<SUBSTRING> -H "Authorization: Bearer $<TOKEN>"
  ```

## Blacklist

  ### Add a malicious URL

   ```
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/blacklist -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"url":"enter url"}'
   ```

  ### Remove a malicious URL
  ```
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/blacklist/id
```

If you're using the same terminal, press Ctrl+C to exit this part and continue with the email section.

  ```
##  Implementation Notes

  * The C++ server uses a Bloom Filter to quickly check for URL membership
  * All communication between the web server and C++ blacklist server happens over TCP
  * Data is kept *in memory* in the web server (no database is used)

  ---


## Docker Notes

  * *Blacklist server* expects the file data/urls.txt to exist or will create it
  * Ports used:
    * Node server: 3000
    * TCP server: 5555 (internal communication only)
  * Containers communicate using Docker’s internal network (via container name)

  To stop the services:

  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```
